## About the Capstone Project ⁉️
The main objective behind this project is to use what you learned during the Bootcamp including all libraries and skills that you have gained. Moreover, to evaluate learning outcomes by applying the main concepts using related technologies such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, and scikit-learn. We aim to apply the whole LifeCycle of Data Science and to collaborate as one team on the final project.
> Remember: In data science, mindset then toolset.


## Essential Requirements 📝
In the capstone project, we will wrap up all skills that you learned in the Data Science LifeCycle in multiple phases as the following.

### Phase#1: Bussiness Problem 💡
- You have to find an interesting question or problem and try to answer this question using data science techniques.

### Phase#2: Dataset 💽
- Pick a suitable dataset that helps you to find reasonable answers to your questions.
- Choose a real dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
- The dataset should have at least 5000 records for Machine Learning Algorithms / 10,000 for Deep Learning Algorithms.
- Make sure that you really understand your dataset.

### Phase#3: Data Analysis and Preprocessing (Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)) 🔎📊
- Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, and missing values.
- Draw at least 10 interactive charts that give an overview of your data.
- The charts should have proper formatting including XY-Axis labels and the main title.
- Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly.

### Phase#4: Data Modeling (Machine Learning) 🤖
- Choose three to five proper ML Algorithms.
- Show the reasons behind your choices of ML Algorithms - the reasons must be based on a trusted resource.
- Use two splitting methods (train-test split and cross-validation split).

### Phase#5: Model Evaluation (Model Tuning) 🎛
- Report appropriate evaluation metrics for each model.
- Display the used techniques for accuracy enhancement.
- Create a chart that compares the final results of your selected models.

### Phase#6: Model Deployment 🖥
- Convert your model to .pkl format.
- Use Django to deploy your model on a website.

### Phase#7: Conclusion 🏁
- Write a final conclusion and recommendations (your interpretation of the results).


## Final Deliverables 📦
Each team has to create a capstone project repository with the following files:
1. Notebook file(.ipynb).
2. Dataset file.
3. README.md file with the following sections.
    1. Project Title.
    2. Team members with the role of each one.
    3. Introduction about your project.
    4. Dataset Overview.
    5. Proposed Algorithms.
    6. Final Results and conclusion.
